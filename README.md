# GrayHatCS
Various projects I did as part of my reading of "Gray Hat C#" by Brandon Perry.

Note: OVAs and ISOs for projects are not uploaded on this Github page. Important ISOs and OVAs noted below

Ch.1: None

Ch.2: Badstore_123s.iso (Found on VulnHub, https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/badstore-123,41/),
      CsharpVulnJson.ova (Found on VulnHub, https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/csharp-vulnjson,134/),
      burpsuite.jar      (Found on PortSwigger, https://portswigger.net/burp)
      
      Note: After burpsuite is installed, run it via java -jar in the command line, create a default burp project,
            and connect to it via manual proxy config on a browser. Afterwards, follow this tutorial to get the 
            CA certificate for burp, all while staying connected to that proxy.
